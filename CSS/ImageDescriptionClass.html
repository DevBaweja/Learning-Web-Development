And while pinpointing all of Mother Nature's greatest hits could take a lifetime, we think these 50 out-of-this-world landscapes and awe inspiring wonders from Arizona to Antarctica need to move to the very top of your travel list. </td>

            <td class="A1"> Venezuela overflows with natural wonders, including the world's highest waterfall—the 3,212-foot cascades of Angel Falls, located in the UNESCO-protected Canaima National Park.

            <td class="A1"> Antelope Canyon is a slot canyon (and serious Instagram darling) in the American Southwest. Its Navajo name translates to “the place where water runs through rocks”—an allusion to the canyon’s creation through erosion. The narrow, undulating spaces between rock formations allow for vivid patterns when sunlight filters through the striated stone </td>
